#"""EXTENSION: Euclid's algorithm. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of two positive integers is the largest integer
#that divides evenly into both of them. For example, the gcd(102, 68) = 34.
#We can efficiently compute the gcd using the following property, which holds for positive integers p and q:

#If p > q, the gcd of p and q is the same as the gcd of q and p % q."""
