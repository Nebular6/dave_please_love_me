# recursion_practice
Please have a go at completing some recursive algorithms using this repo.

in order of difficulty i think
Cowndown: Finished
Fibonachi: Finished
Triangular: Finished
Parabolic: Finished
Factorial: Finished
Linear: Finished also very well :)
Binary: Finished but holy shit is that scuffed, couldnt figure out maths for the index of the item
decimal->binary: just realised you left the code for it, guess its done?
Euclids Algorithm: i mean i did it but not recursivly, supprised it woks tho :shrug:
